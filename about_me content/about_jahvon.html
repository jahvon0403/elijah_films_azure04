<h2>About me</h2>
<p>My name is Jahvon Parker, these are a couple of things to get to know me, which are fairly simple to remember. With the first being that Purple is my favorite color, and most people don't know that the color purple is commonly used as the representation of magic in tons of tv shows and movies. Which brings me to the second thing to learn about me is that I love the world of fantasy, and I love the fact that there are no limits to what you can create and its a realm that lets your imagination be free. P.S I also love dragons, like alot.</p>

<h2>My Life Goal</h2>
<p>my life goal is to create films that make people laugh, and express my creativity through film and create a platform to leave my mark on the world. And, to one day meet the people who inspire me to want to keep creating and keep going for that dream, and bring the people who stuck by me old friends, new friends, family and just bring them up with me. So, then I can show people who are like me who have that drive that passion and show them that it is possible to reach the summit you just have to keep climbing. </p>

<h3>Inspiration</h3>
<p>Ive always said to myself that if your dream doesnt make you feel like you wont accomplish it or make you feel doubtful of it, then youre not dreaming big enough. Because, ever since I knew what my dream is Ive had many moments of doubt but thats just my mind and my heart telling me that this dream is bigger than me, this dream is something that will live on past me and I have to make it happen. </p>
